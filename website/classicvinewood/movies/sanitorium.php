                    <p class="about">Set in a sanitorium in the 1920s, a group of lunatics with tuberculosis break out and fight for women's suffrage. They are then eaten by stray dogs, and we follow one runt of the pack as he is taken in by a woman with enormous breasts. One morning the dog is scared by her and accidently bites, giving her a fatal disease from which she dies. The dog then begins to talk in the movie and gives a long speech about how charity is cowardice and selfishness is a virtue.
