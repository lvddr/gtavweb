                    <p class="about">"Before he had a column, he had another man's wife." Horatio Nelson, played by Mitch Dexter, arrives in Naples a hero in 1798. However, the only attention he seeks is from the woman who'd poked out his eye five years earlier: the alluring Emma Hamilton. Both are married, but Nelson has been at sea for so long he'd bone his own mother, and Emma has a real thing for celebrities, even toothless celebrities with only one arm. Plus it turns out that her husband William likes to watch, which means it's a green light all round, except for Nelson's dutiful wife back in England, so he dispatches a killer to end her life. And so begins a torrid love affair, and creepy m√©nage a trois, that becomes one of the biggest scandals of the time. By 1805, however, their sex life is dead... Emma has binged her way to obesity and Nelson can no longer get his column up. It was a common hunger for fame and adventure that first ignited the spark them, and Lady Hamilton knows there's only one way to spice things up in the bedroom again. Blood! "One more battle, Horatio, one more battle." And we all know how well that went... or at least we would if they taught anything other than revisionist Civil War history in American high schools.
