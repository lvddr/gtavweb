He soon realizes this is a terrible idea as the place is full of savages that annoy everyone. He falls in love with a young runaway called Molly who teaches him to believe in himself. Yet her accent is so annoying he kills her. When he's arrested and tried in court for first-degree murder, there is a 40-minute court case sequence, in which Will is repeatedly asked by the Judge, "Aye mate, why did ya do it? Crikey!" He escapes and rows back to civilization.
