                    </div>
                    <p class="about">A Solomon Richards slapstick parody of early 1960s historical epics, starring Chip Hampton as Minimus, a hapless slave-driver in Ancient Rorne who is in love with a donkey. His donkey is taken by the emperor as a love toy, and Minimus must fight gladiatorial bouts to win it back. Holding the most phallic trident ever witnessed on the silver screen, he might just win the adoration of not just the crowd, but the Emperor's daughter too. One of the worst-reviewed and highest-grossing movies in history. Especially the threesome with the daughter and the donkey at the end.
